    width=''150px'' /> <p>Argos API has been built from the ground up as a modern
    API-First Scientific Integrity platform. All our capabilities will be exposed
    as Public APIs to customers that have a plan that include API Access. Argos can
    be integrated in your tools and workflows via this API. </p> <p>In this document
    you can find documentation about the available endpoints as well as usage examples.</p>
    <p>The Argos API follows the best practices of REST API design. You should expect
    every endpoint, parameter and return field documented in here to be stable. We
    will NOT remove them or change their semantic until we release a new major version
    of the API and we will give you enough time to transition to it. You should expect
    this API to get new endpoints, new parameters and new return fields (API expansion)
    on the current version and therefore your code should ignore unknown properties
    when deserializing our responses. </p> '
